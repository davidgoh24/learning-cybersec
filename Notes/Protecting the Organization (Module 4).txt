PROTECTING THE ORGANIZATION

SECURITY APPLIANCES
	- Routers
		- primarily used to interconnect various network swgments together, they usually provide basic traffic filtering capabilities
	- Firewall
		- can look deeper into the network traffic itself and identify malicious behavior that has to be blocked.
	- Intrusion prevention system
		- uses a set of traffic signatures that match and block malicious traffic and attacks
	- Virtual private networks (VPN)
		- let remote employees use a secure encrypted tunnel from their mobile computer and securely connect back to the organization's network
	- Antimalware or Antivirus
		- use signatures or behavioral analysis of applications to identify and block malicious code from being executed
	- Other security devices
		- includes web and email security appliances, decryption devices, client access control servers and security management systems

FIREWALLS
	- a firewall is designed to control or filter which communications are allowed in and which are allowed out of a device or network
	There are different types of Firewall, like
	
	- Network layer firewall
		- filters communications based on source and destination IP addresses
	- Transport layer firewall
		- filters communications based on source and destination data ports, as well as connection states
	- Application layer firewall
		- filters communications based on an application, program or service
	- Context aware layer firewall
		- filters communications based on the user, device, role, application type and threat profile
	- Proxy server
		- filters web content requests like URLs, domain names and media types
	- Reverse proxy server
		- placed in front of web servers, reverse proxy servers protect, hide, offload and distribute access to web servers
	- Network address translation (NAT) firewall
		- this firewall hides or masquerades the private addresses of network hosts
	- Host-based firewall
		- filters ports and system service calls on a single computer operating system


PORT SCANNING
	- Port scanning is a process of probing a computer, server or other network host for open ports.  It can be used maliciously as a reconnaissance tool to identify 
	the operating system and services running on a computer or host, or it can be used harmlessly by a network administrator to verify network security policies on the network.
	
	- Zenmap is a port scanning tool that we can use.

INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS
	- IDS scans data against a database of rules or attack signatures, looking for malicious traffic. If a match is detected, the IDS will log the detection and create an alert for 
	a network administrator. It will not take action and therefore it will not prevent attacks from happening. The job of the IDS is to detect, log and report.
	
	- IPS can block or deny traffic based on a positive rule or signature match. One of the most well-known IPS/IDS systems is Snort.
	
PROTECTING AGAINST MALWARE
	- One way of defending against zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs) is to use an enterprise-level advanced malware detection solution, 
	like Ciscoâ€™s Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) Threat Grid.
	
	- Secure Operations Center Team
		- allows the Csico Secure Operations Center Team to gather more accurate, actionable data
		
	- Incidence Response Team
		- has access to forensically sound information from which it can more quickly analyze and understand suspicious behaviors
	
	- Threat Intelligence Team
		- they can proactively improve the organization's security infrastructure
		
	- Security Infrastructure Engineering Team
		- is able to consume and act on threat information faster, often in an automated way
		
BEHAVIOR APPROACH TO CYBERSECURITY
	- is a form of threat detection that involves capturing and analyzing the flow of communication between a user on the local network and a local or remote destination. 
	Any changes in normal patterns of behavior are regarded as anomalies, and may indicate an attack.
	
HONEYPOTS
	- is a behavior-based detection tool that lures the attacker in by appealing to their predicted pattern of malicious behavior. once the attacker is inside, the network 
	administrator can capture, log and analyze their behavior so that they can build a better defense.


NETFLOW
	- used to gather information about data flowing through a network, including who and what devices are in the network, and when and how users and devices access the network.
	is important cause switches, routers, firewalls equipped with NetFlow can report information about data entering, leaving and traveling through network.
	

PENETRATION TESTING
	- Step 1 : Planning
		- Gathers as much information as possible about a target system or network, its potential vulnerabilities and exploits to use against it.
	- Step 2 : Scanning
		- carries out active reconnaissance to probe a target system or network and identify potential weaknesses which, if exploited, could give an attacker access.
	- Step 3 : Gaining Access
		- will attempt to gain access to a target system and sniff network traffic, using various methods to exploit the system.
	- Step 4 : Maintaining Access
		- will maintain access to the target to find out what data and systems are vulnerable to exploitation. It is important that they remain undetected, typically using backdoors.
	- Step 5 : Analysis and reporting
		- will provide feedback via a report that recommends updates to products, policies and training to imporve an organization's security.
		

	
SECURITY PLAYBOOK
	- how to identify the cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data and capabilities
	- the implementation of safeguards and personnel training
	- a flexible response plan that minimizes the impact and damage in the event of a security breach
	- security measures and processes that need to be put in place in the aftermath of a security breach.
	
TOOLS FOR INCIDENT DETECTION AND PREVENTION
	- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
		- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system collects and analyzes security alerts, logs and other real-time and historical data from security devices on the network 
		to facilitate early detection of cyber attacks.
	- DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
		- is designed to stop sensitive dta from being stolen from or escaping a network. It monitors and protects data in three different states: data in use, data in motion and data at rest.
