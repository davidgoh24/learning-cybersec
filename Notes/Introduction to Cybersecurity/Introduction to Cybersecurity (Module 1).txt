What is Cyber security?
- is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

Types of organizational data
- Traditional Data
	- typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. Such as 
		- Transactional data like buying and selling
		- Intellectual property like patents, trademarks and new product plans
		- Financial data like income statements, balance sheets
- Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data
	- Is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and etc. All of it are conntected to the internet, with the ability to collect and share data.

Foundational principles for protecting information
- CIA, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availbility.
	- Confidentiality 
		- is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people
	- Integrity 
		- ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification.
	- Availbility 
		- means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed.
	
Types of Attackers
- Amateurs or Script Kiddies
	- They are amateur or inexperienced hackers who use existing tools or instructions found on the internet to launch attacks.
- White hat attacks (Good hacker)
	- breaks into networks or computer systems to identify any weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved
- Grey hat attacks (In the middle hacker)
	- may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their agenda.
- Black hat attacks (Bad hacker)
	- take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.
	
Internal and External Threats
- Internal
	- can accidentally or intentionally:
		- mishandle confidential data
		- facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the organization's computer system
		- invite malware onto the organization's network by clicking on malicious emails or website.
- External
	- Amateurs or skilled attackers outside of the organization can:
		- exploit vulnerabilities in the network
		- gain unauthorized access to computing devices
		- use social engineeringh to gain unauthorized access to organizational data.

The purpose of Cyberwarfare
- resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.
